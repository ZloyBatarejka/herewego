            Of the Human nations of the Old World, the most important by far is
            that of the Empire of Man, more often called simply "The Empire." It
            was forged by the warrior-king and ascended deity Sigmar from the
            primitive Human tribes of barbarians who inhabited what became the
            lands of the southern Empire more than 2500 years ago.

            the ruthless efficiency of its military and religious orders.

            The greatest nation of the Old World, the Empire of Man is ruled by
            an Emperor and is composed of the descendants of the ancient tribes
            of Mankind united by the great Human warrior Sigmar Heldenhammer
            after the Battle of Black Fire Pass. Sigmar was deified after his
            death by his people and his promise of eternal aid from the Empire
            for the kingdoms of the Dwarfs still stands today.
          </p>

          <p>
            This action solidified the relationship between Men and Dwarfs and
            planted the seeds for the burgeoning Empire through trade between
            the two races. Today, the Empire is led by Emperor Karl Franz I, who
            rules from his court in the Imperial capital city of Altdorf.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are ten provincial states in the Empire, each ultimately ruled
            by a feudal lord known as an Elector Count who owes his or her power
            to the unifying figurehead and ultimate authority of the Emperor. It
            should be noted that the Empire is not truly a single, centralised
            nation, but instead a confederation of individual, feudal states
            united only by the common tongue of Reikspiel, a shared faith in
            Sigmar and a mutual Imperial culture.
